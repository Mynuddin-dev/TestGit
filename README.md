One day you go to the class that is really important to you and that you like a lot.The professor returns the midterm papers to the class you got c++.you are very disappointed.That evening on the way back to your home,you find that you have gotten a parking ticket.Being really frustated,you call your bestfriend to share your experience but are sort of brushed off.
