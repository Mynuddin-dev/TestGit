To give you a better sense of how the two mindset work, imagine - as vividly as you can - mthat you are a you are young adult having a really bad day. 
One day you go to the class that is really important to you and that you like a lot.The professor returns the midterm papers to the class you got c++.you are very disappointed.That evening on the way back to your home,you find that you have gotten a parking ticket.Being really frustated,you call your bestfriend to share your experience but are sort of brushed off.

A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
